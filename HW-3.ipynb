    "##### 1A) Which Algorithm makes the fewest mistakes?\n",
    "\n",
    "The NN algorithm made 8 mistakes, while the NA algorithm made 12. The NN algorithm made fewer mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1B) Which Algorithm is better for the zoo? Explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The NA algirhtm is better for the zoo, because it identifies birds as people less often. The consequences for misidentifying a person as a bird are insignificant compared to the consequences of identifying a bird as a person. Even though NA makes more total mistakes, because it makes fewer mistakes that matter, it is better for the zoo than NN.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1C) During the pandemic the number of visitors plummets, and it is only the zoo keeper visiting. So instead of 52% of the photos taken at the aviary door being people, it is now only 1%. Make new truth tables for both algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "To more accurately show the operation of each truth table, we will use 1000 photos instead of 100. We also choose to round up for values greater than 0.5, as these truth tables are more likely accurate than if we were to always round down to whole numbers.\n",

    "$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty}ye^{-ay^2}dy = \\frac{1}{2a}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$|y|e^{\\frac{-y^2\\left(z^2 + 1\\right)}{2}}$ is symmetric about the origin. Therefore, over the whole interval the integral equals $\\frac{1}{a}$ where $a = \\frac{z^2+1}{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_z(z)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\frac{1}{\\frac{z^2+1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\left(z^2 + 1\\right)}$$\n",

    "This is a Cauchy distribution with parameters: $\\gamma = 1$ and $x-x_0=z$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### c) The 2D Gaussian dsitribution looks like a smeared spot. Mathematically, this is given by $X \\hat{i} + Y \\hat{j}$ where both X and Y are from 1D Gaussian distributions. If we measure the amplitude of this vector, what is its pdf?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $Z = \\sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}$ where $P_X = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}}$ and $P_Y = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{y^2}{2}}$\n",
